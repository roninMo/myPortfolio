            any stack or project that's thrown my way! I'm freelancing while
            actively searching for a job, and I'm happy to build backend
            servers,routing, mvc's, and sql queries for it all. I can build
            front end components from connecting to api's to building
            authentication and front end components, I'm happy to work with any
            stack. My phone number is <b>(317)-908-2517</b> if you'd like to

                <p>
                  I like building authentication and http routing on the front
                  end, it can be tough but it's fun to create that structure. I
                  don't mind using scss or css and have no preference on what
                  libraries we use, getting it plugged in with a great design
                  for the ui is the important part. Building all the different
                  front end components vary between the different frameworks,
                  but I really enjoy building each one thrown my way.

                <p>
                  From grabbing data from other API's to creating our own, this
                  is my favorite part. My last job I pulled a lot of data from
                  different parts of google and other big companies for SEO
                  related analytics for our data scientists, and it was fun
                  building to pull from all the different APIs. It's even more
                  fun to build my own, but I don't mind what task is given to me
                  I'll go build it right away.

                  Creating MVC's and servers are always fun. My main focus is
                  oriented around SQL databases, but I'm also familiar with
                  NoSQL. I'm better at building controllers for the back end
                  than I am working on the front end, and I also like creating
                  the different sql queries to pull the data dynamically.

                <p>
                  I've got experience creating databases manually along with
                  using ORMs to handle this part. I prefer just creating them
                  than relying on an ORM, but I'll work with whatever the
                  project demands. I've used AWS to host the servers along with
                  the databases themselves, using RDS and EC2 mainly for those
                  tasks. I don't mind what cloud platform we'd use whether it's
                  AWS, GCP, or Azure, I'll quickly learn adapt so I can help
                  work on tasks given to me.

            <p>
              I'm building a full stack app for an insurance company through
              freelancing at Upwork to manage all their client information
              safely in the cloud. The database and server will be hosted
              through AWS services. The specific database type I'm creating is
              OLTP with a MySQL database. I'm creating a server with Nodejs and
              Express, and have all the respective controllers and routing are
              specific to the queries needed to handle the different client
              data. The framework is Angular with constant user stories to
              create, tweak and edit all the components for their platform. I'm
              gonna host a local version via firebase and give that to them.

            <h6>Studio Ghibli Angular app</h6>
            <h1>MySQL, Node, Angular, Express</h1>
            <p>
              This was inspired by my final bootcamp project HeartToArt. But I
              built that with an ORM and used sequelize to do the easy way out
              of all my SQL queries, and it's rustic. Now I've created this app
              in a week that grabs all the data from the Studio Ghibli API for
              the site, then allows users to create accounts and login with
              authentication to go in and add that data to their accounts. I've
              implemented Auth and API services, and it wouldn't take long to
              create a back end with an MVC for the users about studio ghibli
              data for each. I'm hosting the app from Firebase. It was built
              with bootstrap, and it's design is pretty nice. My HeartToArt
              project was one of my first projects, it helped me learn the
              fundamentals to bridge my knowledge and understanding for all the
              different stacks, languages and frameworks I know today.

            <h1>Postgres, Express, Sequelize ORM, React, and Node</h1>
            <p>
              I built this in a couple weeks in bootcamp and it's my own
              database integrating data from another api to write reviews on
              each character within it, connected to the users of my own api.
              You've then got an interconnected hub where you can search for any
              rick and morty character or review, and write your own or edit and
              comment on each of them. It comes with authentication, all of
              react's functionality including react hooks, api promise
              functions, our own api with user accounts as well as full access
              to the rick and morty api through your own searches. The backend
              is built with Sequelize, which is an ORM, but check out my OLTP
              database if you're worried about my understanding of SQL, or my
              other PERN stack app. This is one of my first solo agile projects
              and it's pretty solid.

            <p>
              This is a react app that connects to a database to create a todo
              list. I tackled this to built a react app with a backend that is
              oriented around making queries with sql instead of just ORMs,
              check out my rick and morty client for a project that's more
              oriented on the client side of things. For web design check out my
              Studio Ghibli, and OLTP insurance app. I built this early on to
              understand client api calls that connect to SQL queries, and
              quickly realized how awesome that is. I can create complex sql
              queries with database information and pull that through the routes
              instead of using a rigid ORM that's old and archaic. That's the
              only reason I put this on my portfolio, my current work is a much
              nicer design on the front and back end.

              and recreated all of the graphs and visuals for demandjump's
              platform through looker myself. I recreated all of Looker's custom
              visualizations to fit DemandJump's design and needs, along with
              helping design one of their recent products. DemandJump is one of
              the top 10 companies in Indiana, and it was an honor to work with
              a bunch of senior devs on a bunch of important things oriented
              around their platform or storing and retrieving data for their
              analytics.
